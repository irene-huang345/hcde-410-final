    "**<h4>Overall Research Goal**\n",
    "    My research goal is to look at popular songs on tiktok and see how the songs influence what type of dance (hip hop, contemporary, wacking, etc.) is made that makes these short dances go viral. Tiktok has made its own style of dance where it’s “easy” to learn, super short and can be done anywhere. But, when we look at some of the viral dances like renegade or WAP, there is a cultural context that surrounds the dance. I’m curious to know more about users and content creator demographics or backgrounds that engage with this dance/trend and see how this plays a role in the choreography or even popularity within the video. As though Tiktok has its own algorithm on catering content to users, what makes some of these dances that go viral more popular than others? Is it the song choice or the age and popularity of the influencer, etc?"

    "**<h4>Q1:Why are you planning to do this analysis?** \n",
    "\n",
    "I’m planning to do this analysis because I wanted to look at social media in terms of its global audience. Everyone using the platform is from different places and is brought together in this digital and online community. I’m interested in dance and the music I listen to comes from tiktok. As Dance is a form of nonverbal communication and as it utilizes various forms of music (as simple as a beat or a thud), these two components are able to bring people together despite the language barrier or cultural differences they experience and are often a form of self-expression. When we look at WAP, there’s heavy usage of twerking and body rolls which really contributes to a hip hop or sensual street style of dance but that comes from a Black and Caribbean culture. As though popular influencers on Tiktok brought popularity to the dance without crediting the original creator, this leads to the lack of respect for the cultures or creators. However, many people are posting their videos of them doing the dance and as this dance has made its way to different platforms like Youtube, the access to it is not only limited to those in the United States but it spreads to different countries. Thus, I’m kind of curious to know about this global awareness and how these dances are being impacted. Do they gain more popularity because of the song? Or is it the popularity of the creator?\n"

Back in the day, it was emphasized to be cautious about what information we put out but nowadays, we are more open on social media and we voice our opinions. Additionally, there wasn't that much data we found about gen alpha's usage on social media as that is still in the process of developing so I had to rework my problem statement.

As our generation or time is increasingly scrolling on social media, with the majority of the clips containing a snippet of audio, there are more remixes or versions  of a song to fit a certain context and as though these aren’t official, many people favor them and use them in the videos they create. Sometimes, I like to scroll tiktoks so I can listen to the music and update what I’m listening to and sometimes, they are strong enough to evoke a certain emotion from me so I’m curious if the use of music in tiktoks is something that drives user engagement within the app. Thus, I want to compare it to the top songs on Spotify and see if there is any correlation between the popularity of the track and what musical characteristics they might share.\n",

From a more practical standpoint, I think it’s really beneficial to look at the exposure levels of each song on both platforms which is most likely by looking at popularity or streaming number of the track as this may play a role in the marketing/algorithm used to promote music . Additionally, as tiktok is a way to find music, tiktok is also a platform of self expression whether that is creating memes, vlogs or short dances which makes me wonder if the music available on tiktok generates more user engagement. Most likely, some of the versions of each song may not be found on spotify. By examining the cultural context or trends of these platforms could also give insight into technicalities of each song and seeing if those are factors into user engagement like we mentioned earlier or looking at what emotions a song might convey to make it popular. \n"

    "There was a case study on \"Viral Tiktok Artists' Spotify Monthly Listers vs. Followers\" which resulted in as songs on Tiktok goes viral not many people know the artist and the artists themselves don't have a high follower count either[1]. There was another case study \"Tiktok vs. Spotify: The shape of music thru an interface\" in which they revealed that spotify is a more enrgy oriented platform which really does target one of the generalizations that I wanted to make after answering my research questions[2].\n",
    "The previous work that has been done in this field pushes me to proceed forward because even if the answers exist to the research questions I have, I still want to do this research myself and see the answers that I get. From there, I can compare if the answers are the same and it turns into a challenge if the answers are different. \n",

    "To investigate this phenomenon, I will first filter the data in terms of removing any uncompleted rows of data or removing any duplicate rolls. Then, I will merge the two datasets so I can look at the data collectively. \n",

    "**For research Q1:**\n",
    "For each musical characteristic across all the songs, I'll have to calculate the mean and perhaps, the standard deviation and put the data onto a histogram as I can look at the skew of the graph. This gives me a summary of all the statistics and for each platform which allows me to generalize the data and draw conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For research Q2:**\n",
    "I could use a t-test to answer this question as I can pull the means for each of the musical characteristiscs and look at the major differences between each of the characteristic on both platforms. I can then put this data on a boxplot so that will be able to show me the concentrated mean alongside what outliers we have. Using this method and visualization would help with seeing if there are any differences between the musical characteristics and would give me the generalizations that I'm looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For research Q3:**\n",
    "I plan to use a scatterplot to visualize this data and use a correlation analysis to look at the popularity of a track on tiktok and the peak rank of a song on spotify. This would help analyze the relationship between the two songs on the different platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For research Q4:**\n",
    "Using a regression analysis would help as we would be able to look at the correlation amongst each of the songs on the platform so it's great for crowdsourcing all the songs and if we show that tiktok is the independent variable and spotify is the dependent variable, that would hopefully give us a direct answer to the question."
